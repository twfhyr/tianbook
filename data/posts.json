    "body": "<p>I wanted my blog to be fast, simple, and easy to maintain. No heavy frameworks, no build steps â just clean HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</p><h2>Design Principles</h2><ul><li><strong>Minimalism</strong> â Content comes first. No clutter.</li><li><strong>Performance</strong> â Zero dependencies means instant loads.</li><li><strong>Simplicity</strong> â Easy to understand, easy to modify.</li></ul><h2>The Stack</h2><p>The entire site is built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JS. Blog posts are stored as JSON data, which keeps things straightforward while still allowing dynamic rendering.</p><blockquote>The best tool is the simplest one that gets the job done.</blockquote><h2>What's Next</h2><p>I plan to add more posts regularly and possibly introduce features like dark mode and a search function in the future. For now, I'm happy with this clean foundation.</p>"
